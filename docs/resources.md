# Resources

New to the world of Rust and/or JavaScript interpreters and interested in learning more? Below are some non-exhaustive links
to generally useful online resources.

## Rust

Below are some useful resources to get yourself off the ground with Rust.

- [The Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)
- [Rust Project's Learning Portal](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn)

## JavaScript

JavaScript is pretty ubiquitious at this point in time, and our base assumption is that you are at least familiar
with JavaScript if you are visiting this project. Nonetheless, in the context of this project, the link to the
ECMAScript specification may be useful.

- [The ECMAScript Specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/)

## Intepreters

Programming languages are really cool and interesting. Below are some general resources regarding language interpretters.

- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom
