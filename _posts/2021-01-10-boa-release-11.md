Happy New Year!

Boa has reached a new release. v0.11, our biggest release yet.
This release has had [commits] and [num contributors], the engine has been faster and more compliant since v0.10. What we have here are some of the highlights but please see the [changelog link] for more information.

## Test 262

Test262 is the implementation conformance test suite maintained by TC39. It's used by nearly all engines to measure how conformant they are to the specification. Boa pulls the tests in-tree and runs against PRs and on a nightly basis. Test262 doesn't sit still, changes and features get added to te test suite also updates, since the last release we've updated our reference to make sure we're running against the latest spec. You can find out more about Test262 [here](https://github.com/tc39/test262)

Since v0.10 we have almost doubled on spec conformance, and reduced panics from hundreds to less than 50. A year ago Boa didn't even track itself against Test262 so it was difficult to know how compliant we were to the spec, today not only do we track all changes against Test262 but we can see progress on a PR to PR basis.

For live tracking of conformance tests you can check [here](https://boa-dev.github.io/boa/test262/). Below is a snapshot of the previous version and today.

## Regress

In this release Boa switched from `regex` to the [`regress`](https://github.com/ridiculousfish/regress) crate for regular expressions. Regress is a project aiming to implement ECMAScript compliant regular expressions and Boa makes use (and contributes back to) that. Shout out to [ridiculousfish](https://github.com/ridiculousfish) who maintains the project.

While Regress is not 100% spec compliant this is something which is being worked on, also the switch (with some other refactoring) gave us quite a performance boost in our [benchmarks](https://boa-dev.github.io/boa/dev/bench/) we're seeing almost 6X faster execution.

The above image shows a big drop in the middle of the graph, above `fb1b8d5` is where we switched over. Conformance went from 19.01% to 18.99% and introduced some panics, however many of those have since been fixed.

## Iterating over bytes

Previously the lexer iterated over Unicode chars (u32 code points), this wasn't strictly neccesary for Boa and we have instead changed the lexer to work over bytes (u8). This is standard practise amongs lexical analyzers and even browsers read source code byte-by-byte, using the rules of the language's syntax to convert the source text into tokens.

Most [changes](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/915/files) included switching to the Rust `b'` prefix for characters which tells rust to treat the value as a byte literal.

## Thank You

Everything in this release has been such a huge effort, we thank everyone who contributed, whether it was features, fixes or raising bugs.
