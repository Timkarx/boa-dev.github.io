Boa has reached a new release. v0.13, our biggest one yet!

Since v0.12 we've closed ?? issues and merged ?? pull requests. The engine has been faster and more compliant to the spec. Below are some of the highlights but please see the [changelog link] for more information.

What is Boa? See the [About](/about) page for more info.

## New Features

This release brings some new features, such as support for the [Relative Indexing Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/at) (better known as `at()`). Thanks to @neeldug for adding this. Other additions include `replaceAll()`, `Object.values()`, `Object.preventExtensions()`, `splice()`, `sort()` and more.

## Test 262

Test262 is the implementation conformance test suite maintained by TC39. It's used by nearly all engines to measure how conformant they are to the specification. Boa pulls the tests in-tree and runs them against all PRs. You can find more about Test262 [here](https://github.com/tc39/test262).

Since v0.11 we have 10% more conformance and reduced panics. To put that into perspective that's almost 10,000 more tests that pass since when version 0.11 was released. We've dropped from 26 tests panicing to zero.

## Keeping up with Rust!

As we work on Boa Rust is changing underneath us. This means we need to make sure our code is conforming the latest standards and we're taking advantage of the best optimizations Rust can provide. In order to do this we rely on Clippy, this is Rust's in-house linter. We updated our code to [respect the latest Rust version](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/1352) and update [formatting](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/1356). Often a nice bonus of doing this is getting performance improvements for free as Clippy gets more "smarter". Thanks to @neeldug and @RageKnify for the work in this area.

## Keeping things in order

Previously object properties were stored using [`FXHash0`](https://crates.io/crates/fxhash). Despite being very fast it was not guarunteeing any order. Properties need to retain the same order they were entered. In order to achieve this we switched over to [IndexMap](https://docs.rs/indexmap/1.7.0/indexmap/). Traits in Rust make this easy as IndexMap was designed to be a drop-in replacement for other HashMap implementations by following the same Trait. Performance losses were minimal on some benchmarks and we actually made some gains in others.

## Re-design VM for better space efficiency

There is still on-going work to utilise a VM, this is happening [alongside](https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/blob/master/docs/vm.md#state-of-play) how Boa runs today. Although its not exposed yet there has been plenty of refactorings to the VM in order to make it performant. https://github.com/boa-dev/boa/pull/1361
